### Notes:
- Replace `customer_data.csv` with your actual dataset and adjust the feature columns in the code as needed.
- You can further enhance the analysis with more complex models, additional visualizations, or deeper EDA based on your insights and the data available.
- Ensure that you have the required permissions to use the dataset if itâ€™s not your own.
